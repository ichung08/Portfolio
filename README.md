My personal website, filled with my experiences, projects, and thoughts!

I've been needing to create a personal website and learn react/JS - so I figured that my first react project would be this!

This site is built entirely with JS/HTML/CSS.

Huge thanks to @ianmah for all your help and to [Jacky Zhao's](jzhao.xyz) website for being great inspiration.
