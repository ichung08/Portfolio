      <h1>Hey, I'm Isaac! 👋</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a student at the University of British Columbia studying Cognitive Systems + CS. This website is an overview
        of some of my experiences and thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only started coding halfway through my first year, and I'm still navigating through the tech industry. My
        future career aspirations are still unclear, but I hope to sample and gain a general understanding of the
        industry before specializing in the future.
