        I'm a student at the <b>University of British Columbia studying Cognitive Systems + CS</b>. This website is an
        overview of some of my experiences and thoughts.

        I started coding halfway through my first year, and I'm still navigating through the tech industry. My future
        career is still unclear, but I hope to sample and gain a general understanding of the industry before
        specializing in the future.

        family and friends.
